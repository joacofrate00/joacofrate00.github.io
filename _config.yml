          The automotive industry is constantly growing and cars are getting
          increasingly more tech-focused which means a lot of programmers and
          developers are needed. This is what helped me discover AROBS and their
          Embedded C Internship program. During this internship I learned a lot
          of techincal skills, such as how <mark>Git</mark> works and how
          effectiv proper teamwork is.

          A lot of children nowadays get increasingly curious about how
          computers work and especially how their favorite games work. This is
          where I step in, working as an IT Instructor, I helped teach children
          how computers work and think, helping them think mathematically and
          logically. Logiscool also offers a Robotics course which I also
          taught, it based on Lego Mindstorms and coding in their proprietary
          platform. The children where taught using ScoolCode, a proprietary
          coding language based on Scratch and <mark>JavaScript</mark>.

          Every company needs its websites properly administered and Aquamar
          Solutions is no exception. Keeping a retail company working is hard
          and I made sure the online part stayed up-to-date and working. During
          my time here I worked on 4 websites that were part of the company
          simultaneously, and learned a lot about WordPress and <mark>HTML5 +
